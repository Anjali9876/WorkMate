WorkMate is an Android app that helps students ease their stressful lives by aiding them in tracking their college attendance, notify them when a class starts (according to the timetable), view the floor plan of the college to know the directions and have a QA forum of the college to help students clarify any doubts they have. 

1) The first highlight of the project is that it automizes attendance tracking, that is, students need not manually keep updating their attendance for every class they attend. On attending the first class of a subject the student can set the coordinates of their classroom. Thus, for all the classes of that subject to come, the app will compare the current coordinates of the student and if the the student's coordinates is in the vincinity of the classroom's coordinates, the app will mark the attendance of the student as "Present". Otherwise it will mark the attendance as "Absent".

If a student has been noted as not in the classroom at the time of the period by the app, a notification is sent to the student notifying him/her that the class has started. If the attendance of a student goes below 75%, a warning is provided to them.
