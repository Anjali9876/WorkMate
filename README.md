# WorkMate!

## Software Engineering Project

This is a Flutter application for mobile platforms. 
The target users are the students and faculties of Amrita School of Engineering, Amritapuri.

The app has two main features, namely attendance management and calendar dashboard.
The app provides the following benifits to the users (faculties and students):
* Faculties get to know work allotted to the students and assign accordingly.
* Faculties can easily manage attendance without holding book registers or laptop.
* Students can know their attendance constantly.
* Students can view their allotted work on the calendar.
